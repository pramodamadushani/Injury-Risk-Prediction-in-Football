# Injury-Risk-Prediction-in-Football
This project aims to predict the injury risk of professional football players using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset contains player attributes, match statistics, and injury history to train models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
The dataset includes physical attributes, player performance, injury records (past and current seasons), and match statistics.
This dataset is from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolambekalpesh/football-player-injury-data/data).
